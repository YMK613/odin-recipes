Odin Projects

--
Set up your README.md file and write a brief introduction 
describing what the current project is and what skills you will 
have demonstrated once you have completed it. (You can also do this as a 
self-reflection at the end of the project, which is a good way to review
what you have learned.)

This project makes sure you know how to:
	* Link pages
	* Add images
	* Display it on Github
